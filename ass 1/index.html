                I'm Chukwunenye Chidiebere, a recent university graduate doing
                everything possible to make good use of the free time I'm forced to
                have. Web Development catches my fantasy. In these passed four
                months, I've failed, lost interest, lost my mind a bit but I always
                found a reason to start again.

              I'm passionate about doing an outstanding job and have recieved
              multiple compliments for collaborative, quick critical thinking,
              and logical technical skills to improve work efficiency. <br />
              I really enjoy providing and implimenting responsive, interactive
              and stricking website. I thrive in the excitment of optimistic
              individuals and goal getters, as someone that enjoys working with
              a team to achieve excellence, I enjoyed the time spent working
              with team5 at upskill. <br />
              I play a little with HTML, CSS and Javascript. I'm
              currently on an internship in Nigeria. Abba's special

            <h5>Alt_School and I</h5><br>
            The passed few months in Alt_scool has been one of the most interesting periods I've ever lived. From the really interesting fun fridays which has been so enlightening, to the sometimes chaotic live classes with Mr Setemi, to the cool and collected pre-recorded classes with mr Edwin . Also the sweet banter between Miss Taby and Mr Jerry. I joined Alt_School to be able to improve in my front-end Engineering pursuit, be able to collaborate with like minds, and in the process meet amazing talents. With all I get from Alt_School, I hope to be able to give back to the community in my long journey in the tech space and also make myself proud.
